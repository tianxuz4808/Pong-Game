This is a very basic Pong game that I created (mostly) by myself

I learned most of what I needed from this youtube playlist.

 I used this playlist as an inspiration that helped me figure out the steps I needed to
 implement in order to create a Pong game.
 
 Creating this game helped me understand Java GUI's a lot better. It was also one of the first projects I decided to create without any clear instruction form a professor.
 
 I learned the concept of java packages, as well as learning how to accept Inputs from the user without the use of Scanner.
